### What I learned

I learnt how to change a block element to make it appear inline with inline-block property.

```css
.pricing p,
.pricing h1 {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 30px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](hhttps://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) - This helped me with understanding inline-block property. with the help of this I was able to change the normal flow of <p> from block to inline.
